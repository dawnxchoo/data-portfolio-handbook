# Dawn's Data Portfolio Project Handbook ðŸš§

*WIP -- if you've somehow stumbled upon this repo, I am still building and working on it!*


Every resource & guidance you need to build your Data Science & Analytics portfolio


If you're interested in building a Data Science & Analytics portfolio or already working on one, this repo is for you! You'll find a ton resources to guide you from the initial stages of ideation all the way through to creating a polished, professional portfolio. This portfolio is what you can showcase to hiring managers, discuss in interviews, and highlight on your resume, so that you can ultimately land your dream Data Science or Data Analyst job!

If you're starting to build your portfolio from scratch I recommend following this guide step-by-step. But if you're here looking for specific resources or looking to up-level your data portfolio, feel free to jump to the relevant sections.

By the way, HI! My name is Dawn Choo. I am a Data Scientist and a Data content creator. I write every day on LinkedIn and Instagram to 100k+ followers. I also have a newsletter (about Data careers) where I publish a new article every other Wednesday â€” sign up here at www.askdatadawn.com. Because I have written extensively about this topic across all of my platforms, you might find that I link to some of my posts & newsletters! My goal, however, is to make this repo as comprehensive as possible, so I include link from a wide range of resources.

## Project planning & ideation

A data "portfolio" typically contains multiple projects. Before we discuss creating the full portfolio, let's focus on building individual projects. This section provides instructions for finding datasets, developing project ideas, exploring sample projects, and following guided tutorials to help you get started.

### Where to find datasets

**Static datasets**

### **Guided project resources -- start here if youâ€™re building your first project**

The ultimate goal would be to build completely self-driven projects, that are in your target industry. But if this is your first Data portfolio project, it could be helpful (read: less intimidating) to start with one of these guided projects!

### Role-based portfolio skills

Every data role has unique expectations and required competencies. Whether you're targeting a Data Scientist or Data Analyst position, your portfolio needs to demonstrate role-specific skills that hiring managers are looking for. For this repo, we are only focused on Data Sience & Analytics roles, so we will not be covering other roles like Data Engineering or AI Engineering.

* What skills to showcase for each target role (DS, DA, DE, etc.)
* What makes a project impressive to hiring managers
* \


### Tools & tech stack

Of course, every product you build will require tools. We'll cover in this section what tools (free & paid) you can use for your project.

* Choosing the right tools: SQL, Python, R, Excel, Tableau, etc.
* How to add interactivity: dashboards, Streamlit apps, and more


### Project documentation

Great analysis means nothing if no one can understand your work. This section covers everything from writing comprehensive analysis plans to structuring your documentation for maximum clarity (and maximum hire-ability ðŸ˜‰).

* How to write an analysis plan (with template)
* How to structure project documentation
* How to show your thought process using issues or notebooks


### Hosting your portfolio

Finally, our last step is where to host your portfolio. There are so many great options out there, so how do you pick. *Spoiler alert â€” I have a favorite and it's Notion (because it's free and easy-to-customize).* We'll also cover some common mistakes people make when building their portfolio and how to best present your projects in interviews.

* Where to host your data portfolio (GitHub, personal site, Notion, etc.)
* How many projects do you need for a strong Data portfolio
* Common mistakes in a Data portfolio and how to avoid them
* Tips for presenting your project in interviews
