By the way, HI! My name is Dawn Choo. I am a Data Scientist and a Data content creator. I write every day on LinkedIn and Instagram to 100k+ followers. I also have a newsletter (about Data careers) where I publish a new article every other Wednesday — sign up here at www.askdatadawn.com. Because I have written extensively about this topic across all of my platforms, you might find that I link to some of my posts & newsletters! My goal, however, is to make this repo as comprehensive as possible, so I include link from a wide range of resources.
